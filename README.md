# SifEventAnalyzer
I did it since I want to know how the tier scores grow with time.
Started with the T1 score of the recent YohaMaru Event for some intial understandings of the data. They will be helpful for analyzing other scores as well as other events.

So far:
1. T1 score boosts up quickly in the first 10 hours of the event, as well as ~the last 5 hours of the event. An 3rd-order polynomial will be a good regression model to start with.
2. Between day 2 and day 8, the growth of T1 score wrt time is linear and the slope is around 23.7.
